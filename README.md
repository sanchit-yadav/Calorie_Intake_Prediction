## Calorie Intake Predictor

- In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is a growing concern. Individuals often struggle to track their daily calorie intake, leading to poor dietary habits and health issues such as obesity, malnutrition, or chronic diseases. There is a need for a user-friendly tool that helps people monitor their calorie consumption based on their personal attributes and lifestyle choices.


### 1) Project Overview:

- The goal of this project is to develop a Calorie Intake Calculator that allows users to input key information such as age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary preferences. Based on this data, the calculator will estimate the recommended daily calorie intake and help users log their meals to track actual consumption. The tool should provide feedback on whether users are meeting, exceeding, or falling short of their daily goals, and offer suggestions for improvement.
